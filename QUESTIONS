1. What are the default values for different data types?
2. How do you get the seed of the last run so that you can rerun with the same seed?
3. Does SKETCH simplify code in the output once holes have been filled up. For instance, does:
    if (??) {
      x = x + 1;
    } else if (??) {
      y = x + 1;
    }
    get simplified to
    x = x + 1;
    or y = x + 1;
    depending on the values of the holes.
4. What is the catch in using SKETCH? Why would a theorem prover be preferable?
