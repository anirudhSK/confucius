1. if (??)
   else if (??)
   is bad form.

   Use
   opcode = ??(N)
   if (opcode == 0) {

   } else if (...) {

   } else {
     assert(false);
   }

   Don't pass opcode as a parameter.

2. Returning structs is fine.
3. Start with smaller ints and go slowly. Don't shoot for 32 bits right away.
4. Specify bits manually using ??(N), and NOT cbits (no one does that anymore).

// sketch example2.sk --bnd-inbits=32 works

// sketch example2.sk --bnd-inbits=32 --bnd-cbits=32 fails saying
// UNSATISFIABLE ASSERTION Assert at example2.sk:32 (7569693144283297320)

(Ok, so inbits and size of holes should be the same, inbits can't be lesser or greater).

Summary: Don't tweak inbits and cbits until and unless you get it working for the default setting.
